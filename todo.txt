- foreign key constraints handling would be nice (update, dont just truncate / nuke & pave)
    - google: "update values with psql from csv for a table that has constraints"

- libreoffice auto-import (translate the CSV configuration to macros or something for libreoffice)
    ... the dialogue is really annoying
